# Example

The *react-faceted-token-input* component comes with a working example that runs by default in port 3000.

To start the server, from the react-faceted-token-input folder run:

    npm start


To change the default port go inside `server.js` and on line 20 change the port number:

```javascript
    app.listen(3000, 'localhost', function(err) { ... }
```
