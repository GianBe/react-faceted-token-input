# Test

This component comes with a test suite to unit test the `onLeftRight` function,
that handles the selection of the tokens inside the input.
The test suite uses the Jest framework to run the tests.
To replicate the tests run

    npm test

from the *react-faceted-token-input* folder.

**NOTE**:

* you should have your developer enviroment ready before running the
  test, see the [development](../development.md) documentation.
